🫁 Pulmonary Disease Prediction using Machine Learning & Deep Learning

📌 Project Overview

Pulmonary diseases such as Pneumonia, COPD, Tuberculosis, and Bronchitis are serious respiratory conditions that require early and accurate diagnosis. This project presents an end-to-end intelligent system that predicts pulmonary diseases using a combination of symptom-based survey analysis (Machine Learning) and chest X-ray image analysis (Deep Learning – CNN).

The system is implemented as a Flask-based web application, allowing users to input symptoms and upload chest X-ray images to receive disease predictions along with confidence scores.

🎯 Features

1.Symptom-based disease prediction using ML rule-based weightage

2.Chest X-ray image analysis using CNN (MobileNetV2)

3.Image preprocessing and augmentation for better accuracy

4.Real-time prediction with confidence percentage
